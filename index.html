    <h2> Interest in Accessability </h2>
    <p> One of the reasons why I took this class is to learn how to make front-end design more accessible, and to learn more about different disabilties in general. One thing that I have learned so far from class is how different accessabilities are and how they require very different types of assistive technology.
